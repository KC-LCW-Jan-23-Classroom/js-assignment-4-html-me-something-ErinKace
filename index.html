            <h2>Hi, I'm Erin, and I have too many hobbies.</h2>
            <p>It all started when I was a tiny human who was very bad at talking to people, but who absolutely loved stories and making things. Before I could write I used to staple pieces of printer paper folded in half together and draw abtract stick figures inside to create my own "books." From this my love of drawing was born. It was even better when I learned to write and could express my stories with both words and illustrations</p>
            <p>Fast forward twenty plus years, a useless degree in illustration, working as a graphic artist, and being laid off from my dream job as a print designer, I am now a fully grown human who is bad at talking to people, but who absolutely loves stories and making things.</p>

            <h2>It all comes back to <b>stories</b></h2>
            <p>If I could find through line in all my various interests, it would have to be the stories. They come in many different mediums, but ultimately it all comes back to narrative. Okay, not baking, unless I write a story in icing or something. There's something about exploring other worlds, other perspectives, and endless possibilies, that I find absolutely facisnating.</p>
